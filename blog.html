                <h3>Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h3>
                <p><b>Answer:</b>
                    var is a functional scope that can be accessed globally or within a function other side
                    let and const are block scope, so they only work within the function not accacable outside of the function.</p>

                <h3>Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h3>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> Null means "nothing" or "empty". Used when we want to say "there is no value here". Undefined means "not defined" or "unknown". Used when we forget to assign a value to something.</p>

                <h3>What do you mean by REST API?</h3>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> A REST API is like a messenger between apps on the internet. It helps them talk to each other using simple commands like 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', and 'DELETE'. It's like asking for or giving data stored somewhere far away.</p>
